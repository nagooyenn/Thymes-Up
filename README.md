# Thymes-Up

Our website â€“ Thyme's Up! - is a collection of relatively quick & easy recipes of various types, made for anyone who is just learning to cook, doesn't like to spend too much time in the kitchen, and/or generally has a busy lifestyle. Our recipes come in an interactive recipe card collection, which is one of the shortest & easiest forms to pick out & navigate through a recipe without going through the hassle of scrolling through a long page. 

The attributes that make our website unique include interactive recipe cards, ingredient substitution buttons, recipe submission form for registered users, search results filtering, and personalized grocery list based on the ingredients which the user does not have.
